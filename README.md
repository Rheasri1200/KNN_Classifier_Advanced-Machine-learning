# KNN_Classifier_Advanced-Machine-learning
Built a K-Nearest-Neighbors which is used to predict which cancer viz: Benign or Manignant cancer a person has.The model is trained reshape with Machine Learning Libraries and KNN classifier.
KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. To evaluate any technique we generally look at 3 important aspects:

1. Ease to interpret output

2. Calculation time

3. Predictive Power
